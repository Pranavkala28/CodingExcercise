# Training Data Application

This Python application processes training data from a JSON file, extracts relevant insights, and provides three main functionalities:
1. Counts how many people completed each training.
2. Lists people who completed specific trainings within a specified fiscal year.
3. Identifies trainings that have expired or are about to expire within one month of a given date.
